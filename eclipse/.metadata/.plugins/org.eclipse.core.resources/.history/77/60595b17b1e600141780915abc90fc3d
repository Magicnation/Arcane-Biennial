# -- TUTORIAL OF THE BASICS
botania.entry.tutorial=기본 튜토리얼
botania.page.tutorial0=While one could just go through the various entries in the book at their issue, there's also a "guided tour" of sorts available. Clicking the button below will guide you through the pages useful to getting the gist of the basic concepts of Botania.

# -- AN INTRODUCTORY CLIP
botania.entry.introVideo=인트로 클립
botania.page.introVideo0=이 모드를 플레이하시는 분들 중에 책을 읽는게 잼병인 분들도 계실 겁니다. 그래서 보타니아에는 동영상 가이드 시설이 완비되어 있습니다.. It's to keep in note that this guide acts as an aid and not a substitution for the contents of the &1Lexica Botania&0.<br>To watch this video simply press the &4ENTER&0 key.

# -- LEXICA BOTANIA
botania.entry.lexicon=보타니아 사전
botania.page.lexicon0=botania.page.lexicon0=이 &1보타니아 사전&0은 보타니아에 관련된 모든 식물학 지식의 저장소 입니다. 하지만 당신은 아마 알고계실 것입니다.<br>예상하신대로, 모든정보는 여기에 저장됩니다. 블럭이나 아이템 확인의 편의를 위해  &1보타니아 사전&0을 들고 쉬프트 우클릭하시면 해당하는 페이지로 이동됩니다.
botania.page.lexicon3=Any entries typed in &oItalics&r are &4basic&0 entries, which contain the very basic knowledge required to playing Botania. They should be prioritized over others, most of the sections contain one or more, so a good look through through them is a good idea.
botania.page.lexicon1=&1보타니아 사전&0 조합법.
botania.page.lexicon2=그것은 &1모루&0로 이름을 변경할 수 있으며,커버까지 변경가능합니다.<br>에디션으로 표시된 숫자는 &4보타니아&0의 버전과 일치합니다.

# -- MYSTICAL FLOWERS
botania.entry.flowers=신비로운 꽃들
botania.page.flowers0=Around the world, you may stumble upon a large variety of Mystical Flora. Spotting these doesn't take much work as the flowers themselves emit a fair amount of shine.<br>They come in a total of &416 &0different colors.<br>It's also possible to grow these flowers using &1Floral Fertlizer&0 (read on).
botania.page.flowers1=Flowers as far as the eye can see...
botania.page.flowers2=These flowers can be plucked for &1Mystical Petals&0, that can be used for making magical instruments and plants alike.<br>Right clicking a petal on the ground will &4bury it&0, having it emit particles.<br>These petals can also be crushed into &1Floral Powder&0, which functions much alike any mundane piece of dye.
botania.page.flowers3=Plucking Petals off Flowers.
botania.page.flowers4=Crafting the &1Pestle and Mortar&0.
botania.page.flowers5=Grinding Petals into Powder.
botania.page.flowers6=Right clicking the &1Floral Powder&0 in any &1Wool&0 or &1Carpet&0 changes its color to the color of the powder.<br>By mixing the &1Floral Powder&0 with some &1Bone Meal&0, it's possible to create a different type of fertilizer. The &1Floral Fertlizer&0 will grow a small amount of &1Mystical Flowers&0 in the nearby vicinity, if you ever run low on them.
botania.page.flowers7=Making fertilizer (any powder colors work)
botania.page.flowers8=Using typical flower substances also works
botania.page.flowers10=There's also some taller variants of the typical &1Mystical Flowers&0, spread around the place. These can only be gathered with &1Shears&0, but can be used to obtain twice the amount of petals a normal flower would yield. They're a bit too big for dye, though.<br>They can be made manually by fertilizing a &1Mystical Flower&0 with &1Bone Meal&0.
botania.page.flowers11=Prepare for trouble
botania.page.flowers9=Petals can also be made into blocks

# -- PETAL APOTHECARY
botania.entry.apothecary=Petal Apothecary
botania.page.apothecary0=In order for a botanist to create plantlife that can do its bidding, one would need special means of infusing plants with mystical energy.<br>Luckily, the &1Petal Apothecary&0 does just that.
botania.page.apothecary1=The &1Petal Apothecary&0.
botania.page.apothecary2=This block, when placed in the world and given some water (by use of a &1Water Bucket&0), will accept any &1Mystical Petals&0 thrown at it, releasing their energies.<br>Once one has set the correct petals in, throwing some &1Seeds&0 in will finalize the proccess.<br>Tossing in the full bucket will also fill the recipient with water.
botania.page.apothecary3=Quite a few plants can be made using this method, for more information, read on the &4Functional Flora&0 and &4Generation Flora&0 sections of this Lexicon.<br>Shift-right clicking the &1Petal Apothecary&0 with an empty hand will remove the last item thrown in.<br>Lastly, tossing in &1Vines&0 also gives the block an overgrown visual.
botania.page.apothecary4=Crafting the &1Petal Apothecary&0.
botania.page.apothecary5=Crafting the &1Petal Apothecary&0.

# -- PURE DAISY
botania.entry.pureDaisy=정화의 데이지
botania.page.pureDaisy0=The &1Pure Daisy&0 is not only the most basic, but also the most important flower a botanist can have.<br>This flower will purify any adjacent &1Wood&0 and &1Stone&0 blocks, as seen on the next page, into their purified counterparts, &1Livingwood&0 and &1Livingrock&0, which can be used for crafting.  
botania.page.pureDaisy1=약간의 &4시간&0 을 주시면...
botania.page.pureDaisy2=&1살아있는 나무&0 can be turned into twigs
botania.page.pureDaisy4=A few other blocks can also be purified by placing them around the flower. While not as unique and essential as the living blocks, perhaps this might come in handy. This includes &1Netherrack&0 into &1Cobblestone&0, &1Soul Sand&0 into &1Sand&0 or &1Ice&0 into &1Packed Ice&0.
botania.page.pureDaisy3=하얀색은 밝고 청화합니다.

# -- WAND OF THE FOREST
botania.entry.wand=숲의 지팡이
botania.page.wand0=The general multi-use tool for a botanist is the &1Wand of the Forest&0.<br>This wand, made by, effectively, strapping a pair of &1Mystical Petals&0 of any color to a few &1Livingwood Twigs&0, is required for a good amount of tasks.
botania.page.wand1=The wand has two modes, &4Bind Mode&0 and &4Function Mode&0. In &4Bind Mode&0 it can be shift-right clicked on a compatible block to select it. Shift-right clicking elsewhere binds the two blocks. In &4Function Mode&0 it'll simply not do that for shift-right clicking.<br>The two modes can be switched freely by shift-right clicking on air.
botania.page.wand2=If the wand isn't bound to anything, shift-right clicking a block allows it to be rotated around the axis of the side it's clicked on.<br>For example, clicking on the top of a &1Chest&0 rotates it around. Most blocks which can be rotated should work.
botania.page.wand3=The petals used determine the colors of the wand

# -- RUNIC ALTAR
botania.entry.runeAltar=신비로운 제단
botania.page.runeAltar21=Runic creation is a rather important complex in the advancement of the botanical magics. First and foremost, though, this type of crafting requires a decent knowledge of &4Mana Manipulation&0. Before proceeding further, a read through the important entries (those in &oItalics&r) on that section of the &1Lexica Botania&0 might prove enlightening.
botania.page.runeAltar0=&1Runes&0 are extremely important components of complex magical devices or flora.<br>In order to create these, one would require a &1Runic Altar&0.<br>To utilize this &1Runic Altar&0, start by placing, via either a right click or simply tossing, the components to the rune you want to create.
botania.page.runeAltar1=Proceed by linking a &1Mana Spreader&0 to the altar, and right click it with a &1Wand of the Forest&0.<br>It should be apparent when the altar has received enough &4Mana&0. When that happens, just drop a piece of &1Livingrock&0 on top of it and use the wand on it again to collect your rune.
botania.page.runeAltar2=Crafting the &1Runic Altar&0.
botania.page.runeAltar3=A total of 16 &1Runes&0 exist.<br>The most basic and elementary runes are named after the &4Four Elements&0. The intermediate runes are named after the &4Four Seasons&0, and the most advanced runes are named after the &4Seven Deadly Sins&0. A separate &1Rune of 마나&0 also exists.
botania.page.runeAltar20=Sneaking and right-clicking the &1Runic Altar&0 with an empty hand while it's not accepting mana will remove the last item put into it.<br>Last but not least, attaching a &1Comparator&0 to it will emit signal strength &41&0 if the altar is accepting &4Mana&0 and signal strength &42&0 if it's ready to craft the rune.

# -- TERRASTEEL
botania.entry.terrasteel=테라스틸
botania.page.terrasteel0=&1Terrasteel&0 is a complex magical alloy, infused with a great amount of &4Mana&0. Conjuring it proves not to be a small task. For starters, to create it, one would require a &1Terrestrial Agglomeration Plate&0, set on top of a checkerboard pattern of &1Lapis Lazuli Blocks&0 and &1Livingrock&0. &4Mana&0 would need to be provided to this block, &1Sparks&0 would be the most effective way..
botania.page.terrasteel1=Creating the plate
botania.page.terrasteel2=After the plate is set up and ready to receive &4Mana&0, tossing a single &1Manasteel Ingot, 마나 Diamond and 마나 Pearl&0 on top of it will begin the infusion.<br>Picking up any of the items will halt the infusion causing severe &4Mana Loss&0. The infusion uses half a &1Mana Pool&0 total to create a single piece of &4Terrasteel&0, multiple &1Sparks&0 would make it go faster, too.
botania.page.terrasteel3=The pattern for creating &1Terrasteel&0

# -- BLACK LOTUS
botania.entry.blackLotus=Black Lotus
botania.page.blackLotus0=An elusive flower by the name of &1Black Lotus&0 is known to exist, however, it does not grow or reproduce. Where they can be found or come from is not known.<br>It is known, however, that it contains a strong amount of concentrated &4Mana&0, that can be released by putting it in contact with a &1Mana Pool&0 that already has some in it. Just tossing it would do. 

# -- FLOWER POUCH
botania.entry.flowerBag=Flower Pouch
botania.page.flowerBag0=The laws of physics regarding one's &4Inventory&0 are somewhat skewed in this world. Thanks to that, carrying an array of different colors of flowers turns out to be a major hassle. Luckily, a &1Flower Pouch&0 takes care of all those issues. It can store up to one stack of each color of &1Mystical Flower&0, not only that but it'll passively catch any that enter the holder's inventory.
botania.page.flowerBag1=Pull a copter out of it (any colors work)

# -- WRAP
botania.entry.wrap=뒤틀림
botania.page.wrap0=It seems like the creator of this mod decided to add a weird game mechanic in the form of &1Wrap&0. I don't really know what it does, probably something bad. :/<br>What's this "Fourth Wall" you're talking about...?

# - MANA
# -- AN INTRODUCTION TO MANA
botania.entry.mIntro=마나에 대해서...
botania.page.mIntro0=&4Mana&0 is an ethereal substance. In layman's terms, it is a form of &4mystical energy&0. Its sensorial existence is inconstant, and its color depends on the environment its put in.<br>Mastering &4Mana&0 is one of the most important skills a botanist needs to master.
botania.page.mIntro1=In order to create &4Mana&0, one would require a set of &4Generating Flowers&0 (read the respective section). This &4Mana&0 can be dispersed by utilizing &1Mana Spreaders&0 and stored in &1Mana Pools&0. &4Mana&0 can be used for a myriad of different things. For starters, it can be used for &4Functional Flowers&0 (read the respective section).
botania.page.mIntro2=To get started with mastering the art of &4Mana&0, one would start by learning how to use &1Dayblooms&0, &1Mana Spreaders&0 and &1Mana Pools&0.<br>These form a basic infrastructure for mana, which can be used for all sorts of purposes. Have a read at the &4Functional Flora&0 and &4Magical Apparatus&0 sections of this Lexicon. 

# -- MANA SPREADER
botania.entry.spreader=마나 분배기
botania.page.spreader0=The &1Mana Spreader&0 is the most important component in manipulating &4Mana&0.<br>This is the block that allows &4Mana&0 to travel from point A to point B. When this block is placed on the ground, it'll face one of 6 basic directions. By holding shift-right on it with a &1Wand of the Forest&0, one can orient it to the opposite of where it was clicked. It can be pointed to other blocks with a wand in &4Bind Mode&0.
botania.page.spreader1=Holding a &1Wand of the Forest&0
botania.page.spreader2=The &1Mana Spreader&0 has a small internal buffer of &4Mana&0, which will get filled by nearby &4Generating Flowers&0. This buffer can be viewed by looking at the &1Spreader&0 with a &1Wand of the Forest&0, as demonstrated in the last page.<br>Note that the block needs to be right clicked with a wand to get accurate and adequate values.  
botania.page.spreader3=Holding a &1Wand of the Forest&0 displays a beam which shows where the spreader is pointing at. Hovering over it shows the target. The sparkle that's always shown is the point when &4Mana loss&0 starts to happen.<br>If the target of the spreader is a block that can contain &4Mana&0, and isn't full, the spreader will fire a &4Mana Burst&0, which will travel to the target, and pass the &4Mana&0 along to it.
botania.page.spreader4=The spreader only fires one burst at once, it'll only fire another one when the last one hits the target.<br>Furthermore, the bursts also start suffering &4mana loss&0 after a small amount of time. This can be seen in the beam, which becomes a lot thinner when this happens. There is also a small amount of &4mana loss&0 when a beam enters a spreader.
botania.page.spreader11=Applying a &4Redstone Signal&0 to the spreader will have it cease to function. Case better control is required, a &1Redstone 마나 Spreader&0 is recommended, as it can fire bursts without a target block and works on redstone pulses.
botania.page.spreader5=Crafting the &1Mana Spreader&0
botania.page.spreader10=Right clicking the spreader with a piece of &1Wool&0 will sleeve it. Aside from making it look fancier, it'll also muffle the sound when a burst is shot, making it much less obnoxious when there's a large amount of spreaders in one area.<br>Right clicking with an empty hand will remove the sleeve.

# -- MANA POOL
botania.entry.pool=마나 웅덩이
botania.page.pool0=The &1Mana Pool&0 is, simply put, a storage of &4Mana&0.<br>마나 can be inserted into it by usage of a &1Mana Spreader&0, and any adjacent &1Mana Spreaders&0 will pull mana from it to increase their internal buffer automatically.<br>Any &4Functional Flowers&0 require a nearby &1Mana Pool&0 to draw power from.
botania.page.pool9=&1Mana Pools&0 come in two varieties, a weaker, &1Diluted&0 variety which only stores a very small amount of &4Mana&0 and isn't able to infuse items, and a &1Normal&0 variety, which can store as much as a hundred times more than the dilluted one and can infuse items.<br>Whenever "마나 Pool" is refered elsewhere for scale, it refers to a normal one.
botania.page.pool1=Making a &1Dilluted 마나 Pool&0.
botania.page.pool10=Infusing a normal &1Mana Pool&0
botania.page.pool2=Tossing in some resources into a normal &1Mana Pool&0 will cause them to get infused with &4Mana&0, turning them into more powerful forms.<br>A few examples are &1Iron Ingots&0 or &1Mystical Petals&0.<br>&4Mana&0 reading for this block functions like the &1Mana Spreader&0. A &1Redstone Comparator&0 can also output a signal based on the contents.
botania.page.pool8=For the artistic types, tossing any color of &1Floral Powder&0 in the pool will have it take its color, all sixteen colors are viable for decoration and/or easy labelling.
botania.page.pool3=Infusing &1Manasteel&0
botania.page.pool4=Infusing &1Mana Pearls&0
botania.page.pool5=Infusing &1Mana Diamonds&0
botania.page.pool6=Infusing &1Mana Petals&0
botania.page.pool11=Infusing &1Managlass&0, clear seamless glass.
botania.page.pool12=Infusing &1String&0
botania.page.pool7=Infusing &1Mana Cookies&0, pretty good food.

# -- SPARKS
botania.entry.sparks=스파크
botania.page.sparks0=&1Sparks&0 are interesting entities. Created from a combination of raw energy and &4Mana&0, they have the ability to be placed on top of a few specific &4Mana&0 containing or accepting blocks, mainly, &1Mana Pools&0.<br>Some blocks have the ability to harness &4Mana&0 from &1Sparks&0, but the uses for them seem rather limited right now.
botania.page.sparks1=Placing a &1Spark&0 on top of a &1Mana Pool&0 and another on top of a block that can accept it will allow for the latter to remotely access the reservoirs of the &1Mana Pool&0 when needed, given it's not too far away.<br>To remove a &1Spark&0 simply shift-right click it with a &1Wand of the Forest&0. Regular right clicking shows which other &1Sparks&0 it can transfer to.
botania.page.sparks2=&oholds up spork&r

# -- SPARK AUGMENTATION
botania.entry.sparkUpgrades=스파크에 추가할 수 있는것들
botania.page.sparkUpgrades0=As it seems, &1Sparks&0 are a bit more versatile than it was known previously. A variety of &1Augments&0 can be applied to them to enhance their abilities. It's to note that Augments can only be applied to &1Sparks&0 that lie on &1Mana Pools&0.<br>A &1Spark&0 can only have a single &1Augment&0 at any given time.
botania.page.sparkUpgrades1=Starting off, the &1Dispersive Augment&0 has the &1Spark&0 use up the &4Mana&0 in the pool below, to charge any nearby players' &4Mana&0 containing items.
botania.page.sparkUpgrades2=The &1Dominant Augment&0 will have the &1Spark&0 pull any &4Mana&0 from nearby non-augmented &1Sparks'&0 pools into its own, until it's completely full.
botania.page.sparkUpgrades3=The &1Recessive Augment&0 will have the &1Spark&0 output all of the &4Mana&0 in its pool into any nearby non-augmented or Dispersive &1Sparks'&0 pools until it's completely empty.
botania.page.sparkUpgrades4=Lastly, the &1Isolated Augment&0 will prevent the &1Spark&0 from interacting with any Dominant or Recessive &1Sparks&0, but still allow it to interact with blocks that can receive their &4Mana&0 through the &1Spark&0 network.
botania.page.sparkUpgrades5=Crafting the Aguments

# -- MANA DISTRIBUTOR
botania.entry.distributor=마나 배급
botania.page.distributor0=Any botanist will eventually reach a point where a single &1Mana Pool&0 setup is not enough.<br>The &1Mana Distributor&0 will fix all those issues. By placing it adjacently to a few &1Mana Pools&0 on its sides, when it receives &4Mana&0 through &4Mana Bursts&0 it'll equally spread it to the adjacent pools. 
botania.page.distributor1=Crafting the distributor

# -- MANA VOID
botania.entry.manaVoid=마나의 공허
botania.page.manaVoid0=The &1Mana Void&0 is, in layman's terms, the grave for &4Mana&0. Any &4Mana&0 shot into this block will simply vanish into the void, never to be seen again.<br>Placing one of these under a &1Mana Pool&0 allows the pool to always accept &4Mana&0, but disposing any it can't hold.
botania.page.manaVoid1=Even Chad from accounting?

# -- MANA FLUXFIELD
botania.entry.rfGenerator=마나 플럭스 필드
botania.page.rfGenerator0=By passing &4Mana&0 through a field of redstone energy, its state can change from a natural energy source to &4Redstone Flux&0.<br>Simply pointing a spreader at this block will have it shoot at it, converting the &4Mana&0 that lands on it into &4RF&0. It can then be pulled out with any &4RF&0 transporter.
botania.page.rfGenerator1=The bullet guys. I bit it.

# -- MANA LENSES
botania.entry.lens=마나 렌즈
botania.page.lens0=In order to upgrade the potential a &1Mana Spreader&0, one can apply &1Mana Lenses&0. The very basic mana lens does absolutely nothing.<br>Lenses can be &4dyed&0 all the 16 colors of the spectrum, or combined with a &1Mana Pearl&0 to create a &1Rainbow Lens&0. These will change the color of the burst.
botania.page.lens1=아무것도 할 수 없는 기본 렌즈.
botania.page.lens2=&4색&0렌즈!
botania.page.lens3=&1무지개렌즈&0 all the way
botania.page.lens4=But lenses are not only for fancy colors. One can upgrade them with all sorts of materials to create new lens which can do all sorts of effects on the &4Mana Bursts&0.<br>It's to take in mind that, if using a normal &1Mana Spreader&0, there needs to be a &4Mana&0 receiving block at the end for the burst to fire. A &1Redstone 마나 Spreader&0 is recommended for some lenses.
botania.page.lens5=Sometimes, though, having a single &1Mana Lens&0 in a spreader just isn't enough sometimes. By combining two lenses with a &1Slimeball&0 in a crafting table, it's possible to unite them into one, and keep the effects of both.<br>The first lens used determines the visuals (texture and color). It's to note that some combinations will not work, nor will two lenses of the same type.
botania.page.lens6=The &1Velocity Lens&0 will drastically increase the speed at which a &4Mana Burst&0 travels, but not only does the beam start to lose its &4Mana&0 a lot faster, it can also carry a bit less.
botania.page.lens7=속도의 렌즈
botania.page.lens8=The &1Potency Lens&0 will double the amount of &4Mana&0 a &4Mana Burst&0 can carry, however, the beam becomes slower and after it starts to lose mana it does so at a lot faster rate.
botania.page.lens9=힘의 렌즈
botania.page.lens10=The &1Resistance Lens&0 will significantly increase the amount of time the &4Mana Burst&0 can go without starting to lose &4Mana&0, but it makes it a a bit slower.
botania.page.lens11=저항의 렌즈
botania.page.lens12=The &1Efficiency Lens&0 will decrease the amount of time it takes for the &4Mana Burst&0 to start losing its &4Mana&0, but when that happens, it does so at a lot slower rate.
botania.page.lens13=효율의 렌즈 
botania.page.lens14=The &1Bounce Lens&0 will allow the &4Mana Burst&0 to bounce off walls, rather than dissipating on a collision.
botania.page.lens15=산란의 렌즈
botania.page.lens16=The &1Gravity Lens&0 makes the &4Mana Burst&0 be attracted by the world's gravitational pull, thus moving in an arc. As compensation, it also slightly increases the time before &4Mana&0 loss starts to happen.
botania.page.lens17=중력의 렌즈 
botania.page.lens18=The &1Bore Lens&0 charges the &4Mana Burst&0 with the ability to break any blocks it comes into contact with, draining its own mana to do so.
botania.page.lens19=관통의 렌즈
botania.page.lens20=The &1Damaging Lens&0 charges the &4Mana Burst&0 with the power to damage any living beings it comes across, draining its own mana to do so.
botania.page.lens21=데미지의 렌즈
botania.page.lens22=The &1Phantom Lens&0 is an interesting one. By utilizing the &1Abstruse Platform&0 and its' properties, it's possible to make a lens that'll allow the &4Mana Burst&0 to pass through blocks. In doing so, the time it can stay without losing mana is decreased.
botania.page.lens23=환상의 렌즈
botania.page.lens24=The &1Magnetizing Lens&0, as its name states, allows the &4Mana Burst&0 to magnetize, or home in, on any nearby blocks that can receive &4Mana&0. Doing so slightly decreases the speed of the burst.
botania.page.lens25=자기력의 렌즈
botania.page.lens26=The &1Entropic Lens&0 imbues the &4Mana Burst&0 with entropy, causing it to release its energy in the form of an explosion when it collides against something that can't receive &4Mana&0.
botania.page.lens27=엔트로피의 렌즈
botania.page.lens28=The &1Influence Lens&0 allows the &4Mana Burst&0 to have influence over any nearby &4dropped items&0, &4experience orbs&0 and even &4falling blocks&0, having them move in the exact same vector of motion as the burst itself.
botania.page.lens29=영향의 렌즈
botania.page.lens30=The &1Weight Lens&0 carries a strong burden on the &4Mana Burst&0, making any block hit by it, if there doesn't happen to be a block below it, fall, similarly to how &1Sand&0 and &1Gravel&0 do.
botania.page.lens31=무게의 렌즈
botania.page.lens32=The &1Kindle Lens&0 is infused with a burning spark, when it hits a block it'll set it on fire. It has the ability to both ignite and close &1Nether Portals&0. It doesn't seem to set any living beings on fire, though.
botania.page.lens33=광원의 렌즈
botania.page.lens34=The &1Force Lens&0 acts as a &1Piston&0, when it hits a block that a piston can move, it'll do just so.
botania.page.lens35=강제의 렌즈
botania.page.lens36=The &1Flash Lens&0, in contact with a block, creates a flame of the same color as the burst that caused it. The flame provides light and is purely decorative.<br>If it hits one of these flames, it puts it out instead.

# -- MANA TABLET
botania.entry.manaTablet=Mana Tablet
botania.page.manaTablet0=While using &1Mana Spreaders&0 to transport &4Mana&0 around is all well and good, there is also a way of doing it in a different manner.<br>The &1Mana Tablet&0 is a portable object which can carry &4Mana&0 on itself.<br>Not only that, but other items can also pull from it as they need it for their uses, making this an essential tool.
botania.page.manaTablet1=Tossing one of these on top of a &1Mana Pool&0 will allow for transport of &4Mana&0 between one and another.<br>Shift-right clicking the &1Mana Pool&0 with a &1Wand of the Forest&0 will change in which way the &4Mana&0 flows.<br>Lastly, unlike normal items, these will never despawn when dropped on the floor.

# -- MANA MIRROR
botania.entry.manaMirror=Mana Mirror
botania.page.manaMirror0=A &1Mana Mirror&0 is an alternative to &4Mana&0 containing items such as a &1Mana Tablet&0. It can be bound to a &1Mana Pool&0 in the world and items will pull out of the pool itself when needing &4Mana&0.<br>To bind a mirror to a pool, one would simply &4shift right-click&0 a pool with the mirror. The mirror can't put mana in or take mana out of pools in any other way.
botania.page.manaMirror1=Mirror mirror on the wall...

# -- MANA DETECTOR
botania.entry.manaDetector=마나 감지기
botania.page.manaDetector0=A device like the &1Mana Detector&0 is capable to detect when a &4Mana Burst&0 starts flowing through it (the burst doesn't dissipate on collision with this block) and provide a redstone signal when that is the case.
botania.page.manaDetector1=Crafting the detector

# -- REDSTONE MANA SPREADER
botania.entry.redstoneSpreader=레드스톤 마나 분배기
botania.page.redstoneSpreader0=By combining a &1Mana Spreader&0 with a piece of &1Redstone&0, it's possible to create a &1Redstone 마나 Spreader&0, which fires only when given a &4Redstone signal&0, regardless of having a block in the end to put the mana or not.<br>It's to keep in note that this doesn't let the spreader shoot a burst until the last one dissipates or is absorbed.
botania.page.redstoneSpreader1=Just add redstone

# -- MANASTAR
botania.entry.manastar=마나의 별
botania.page.manastar0=The imprecise measurements of the &1Wand of the Forest&0 sometimes won't cut it for telling if you're turning a profit or loss in your &1Mana Pools&0.<br>Creating a &1Manastar&0 and placing it next to your pools will have it shine red if there's a loss or blue if there's a profit. The measurement happens every few seconds.

# -- ELVEN MANA SPREADERS
botania.entry.dreamwoodSpreader=요정의 마나 분배기
botania.page.dreamwoodSpreader0=Simply put, &1Dreamwood&0 conducts &4Mana&0 better than &1Livingwood&0. Add in some adjustments like &1Elementium&0 or &1Mana Petals&0 and what you get is a &1Mana Spreader&0 that can conduct more &4Mana&0, faster and for more time without &4Mana loss&0.<br>On the negative side, it can't be turned into a &1Redstone 마나 Spreader&0.
botania.page.dreamwoodSpreader1=더 나은 확산기, 그게 답니다
botania.page.dreamwoodSpreader2=By combining this already powerful spreader with a &1Gaia Spirit&0 and a &1Dragonstone&0 gem, one can create an even more potent variant. The &1Gaia Spreader&0 is within the top percentage of 마나 Spreaders, with pretty much upgrades all round.
botania.page.dreamwoodSpreader3=엄청난 확산기

# -- PAINTSLINGER LENS
botania.entry.paintLens=Paintslinger Lens
botania.page.paintLens0=The &4Elves&0 are one crafty bunch. This lens is somewhat unique in comparison to the other lenses. The &1Paintslinger Lens&0 needs to be dyed one of the 16 colors of the spectrum to function. When it hits a colorable block (&1Wool, Stained Clay or Glass&0...) it'll turn any blocks connected, of the same type and color, into the color of the &4Mana Burst&0 itself. It seems to work with &4Sheep&0 too.
botania.page.paintLens1=A M'AIDER Stranded Girl

# -- WARP LENS
botania.entry.warpLens=Warp Lens
botania.page.warpLens0=The &1Mana Lens: Warp&0 is an interesting one. A &4Mana Burst&0 with its effect, when colliding with a &1Force Relay&0 will teleport to the end position of said &1Force Relay&0, maintaining its momentum. Furthermore, when it's used as a composite material to a &1Bore Lens&0 (the &1Bore Lens&0 must be visible) it'll make the lens not break &1Force Relays&0 or &1Pistons&0, as well as teleport any blocks to the spot where the burst was fired.
botania.page.warpLens1=Hakase Quarries

# -- MANA PRISM
botania.entry.prism=Mana Prism
botania.page.prism0=The concept of &1Mana Lens&0 allows for the manipulation of the power convyed through &4Mana Bursts&0, the &1Mana Prism&0 works on that technology to allow a burst to have its lens effect switched on the fly.<br>Using a &1Spectral Platform&0 as a component, this block does not have a physical presence, entities and bursts can go through it as if it doesn't exist.
botania.page.prism1=Right clicking it with any variety of &1Mana Lens&0 sets the lens in the prism. Whenever a &4Mana Burst&0 goes through the prism, its color and effect will be set to that of the lens in the prism. Case the lens is not dyed, the burst will turn white.<br>Using any of the four basic lenses also increases the time the burst can go before losing &4Mana&0, allowing it to go further.
botania.page.prism2=It can also be turned off by the use of a redstone signal.
botania.page.prism3=Another pixel in the wall

# -- MANA ON RAILS
botania.entry.poolCart=Mana on Rails
botania.page.poolCart0=What could be an easier way to transport &4Mana&0 over large distances than attaching a &1Mana Pool&0 to a &1Minecart&0 and watch it do the merry-go-round? It's simple. Similarly to other types of carts, one can create a &1Minecart with Mana Pool&0 that can store and transport &4Mana&0 on rails.<br>Breaking the cart while there's any &4Mana&0 in it will waste the &4Mana&0, care should be taken with it.
botania.page.poolCart1=Transfering &4Mana&0 between the cart and a pool is done with a &1Mana Pump&0. It can face any of the four cardinal directions and will transfer &4Mana&0 between a pool adjacent to it and a cart with a pool on an rail opposite to the target pool.<br>The transfer rate is extremely fast due to the mechanical nature, so fast that overflow is possible, causing &4Mana Loss&0.
botania.page.poolCart2=The side of the pump where the &4Mana&0 will go towards is the pink one, &4Mana&0 is pulled from the blue side.<br>The pump can be turned off with redstone, and a &1Comparator&0 on it will output how much &4Mana&0 exists in the cart.<br>Lastly, a pool on a cart serves purely for transport, and can not receive, send, transfer or infuse any items with its &4Mana&0.

botania.page.fIntro1=All &4Functional Flowers&0, alike the &4Generating Flowers&0 contain a small buffer of &4Mana&0.<br>Standard rules for &4Mana&0 reading apply, right clicking with a &1Wand of the Forest&0 will update the mana readings.
botania.page.fIntro2=It is important to keep in mind that these flowers memorize the &1Mana Pool&0 from which they should pull &4Mana&0 out of. They'll only pull from the nearest pool present at the time of the flower being placed (or the closest placed afterward, if none was present), and none other, unless that one is removed. It can be bound to another pool with a wand in &4Bind Mode&0.

botania.page.hydroangeas2=A simple &1수국&0 system
botania.page.hydroangeas3=These flowers, similarly to &1Dayblooms&0 or &1Nightshades&0 will receive a portion of diminishing returns if put in too compact of a pattern. Having any two &1Hydroangeas&0 one block away from eachother, including diagonals, will drastically reduce the production rate of both, as the roots get tangled.

It'll eat up any food in a small area around it, and turn it into &4Mana&0.<br>There's a catch, though, it can only digest a single food at any given time, the &4Mana&0 is created when it's done. Any other food it finds, it'll also devour, but not create any mana from it.
botania.page.gourmaryllis1=The amount of time it takes to digest a delicacy depends on its nutritional value, in layman's terms, the amount of food points it restores.<br>So, a &1Steak&0 will take four seconds to digest, a &1Carrot&0 will take two, a loaf of &1Bread&0 will take two and a half, so on. 
botania.page.gourmaryllis2=The amount of &4Mana&0 created also makes use of this value, but in a way where the more nutritious the food is, the more efficient it is. For example, a single &1Steak&0 will produce more &1Mana&0 from two &1Carrots&0, both absolutely and per second.

If placed down near a &1Slime&0 created by that power, it'll destroy it, collecting all the &4Mana&0 generated by the entropy. The larger the &1Slime&0, the more &4Mana&0 is created.

It'll absorb any and all &1Wool&0 blocks dropped nearby and create &4Mana&0 from them.<br>There's a caveat though. It's picky as to what colors it wants. Starting at white, after it absorbs one piece of &1Wool&0, it'll rotate to the next color in the spectrum.
botania.page.spectrolus1=While it consumes all &1Wool&0 around, it'll only create any mana if its of the color it wants, so haphazardly tossing &1Wool&0 at it is a wasteful strategy.<br>The color it'll absorb properly next can be seen by hovering over the flower with a &1Wand of the Forest&0.

# -- PASTURE SEEDS
botania.entry.grassSeeds=Pasture Seeds
botania.page.grassSeeds0=Watching grass spread is seldom a fun activity. By infusing some &1Tall Grass&0 with &4Mana&0, it's possible to create &1Pasture Seeds&0, which will grow grass in any barren area, via a simple right click on dirt.<br>Other types of foliage can also be grown, such a &1Podzol&0 or &1Mycellium&0 with alternate seeds.
botania.page.grassSeeds1=&1Pasture Seeds&0 for grass

# -- ROD THE LANDS
botania.entry.dirtRod=땅의 막대
botania.page.dirtRod0=The &1Rod of the Lands&0 is a rather simpleton tool, by utilizing &4Mana&0 from your inventory (via a &1Mana Tablet&0 or others), it can materialize and place a &1Dirt&0 block down.
botania.page.dirtRod1=That's dirty

# -- TERRA FIRMA ROD
botania.entry.terraformRod=테라퍼마 블레이드
botania.page.terraformRod0=While digging away at dirt with a shovel is definitely functional, flattening huge tracts of land can get somewhat tortuous at times.<br>By utilizing the &1Terra Firma Rod&0, it's possible to terraform in a quick and environmental friendly manner.
botania.page.terraformRod1=This rod, will, at the cost of some &4Mana&0 from your inventory, flatten the land to the level you are standing. For this to happen, charge it by &4holding right-click&0 and, slowly but surely, the nearby terrain will be flattened to your level, either by placing &1Dirt&0 or by removing blocks.
botania.page.terraformRod2=Note that blocks removed by the rod are non-recuperable. The terrain will adapt to the changes as best as it can, up to a distance limit, to avoid cuts in hills and the like, for this, the flattening will work in the terrain's natural look.<br>Lastly, the rod will cease to function whatsoever below sea level.
botania.page.terraformRod3=Quite a justicar

# -- MANASTEEL EQUIPMENT
botania.entry.manaGear=마나스틸 도구들
botania.page.manaGear0=&1Manasteel&0, alike other metals, can be shaped into tools and armor alike.<br>Tools or armor crafted from this material will share their properties with &1Iron&0, albeit somewhat superior in enchantability and durability. Whenever a &1Manasteel&0 item is to take damage, if there's &4Mana&0 available in the inventory (such as a &1Mana Tablet&0), it'll use that instead.
botania.page.manaGear10=Some pieces of the toolset have an ability when right clicked. The &1Pickaxe&0 will place a torch from the user's inventory, the &1Axe&0 will do the same for a sapling and the &1Shovel&0 will till the earth, similarly to a hoe.<br>A detail to keep in mind is that &1Shears&0 made of mana materials will trigger tripwire, unlike iron ones.

botania.page.grassHorn0=Clearing out &1Tall Grass&0 by hand can definitely be a nuisance.<br>Simply blowing the &1Horn of the Wild&0 will quickly cause any nearby vegetation to uproot, leaving behind drops as if it had been broken by hand.<br>With some modifications, the horn can be modified to break leaves instead.

# -- TERRASTEEL ARMOR
botania.entry.terrasteelArmor=테라스틸 방어구
botania.page.terrasteelArmor0=Armor made out of &1Terrasteel&0, much alike the &1Manasteel&0 counterpart, can utilize &4Mana&0 from the inventory instead of taking damage.<br>This armor, however, has properties more alike &1Diamond&0 instead of &1Iron&0 and increases the wearer's health when worn.

# -- TERRA BLADE
botania.entry.terraSword=Terra Blade
botania.page.terraSword0=The &1Terra Blade&0, crafted from &1Terrasteel Ingots&0, is a sword infused with natural strength. Not only does it par with a &1Diamond Sword&0 in terms of strength and it uses &4Mana&0 from the inventory like &1Manasteel Tools&0, but when swung, there's a chance for it to create a beam that will deal as much damage as a melee hit.
botania.page.terraSword1=No Broken Hero Sword

# -- TERRA SHATTERER
botania.entry.terraPick=Terra Shatterer
botania.page.terraPick0=The &1Terra Shatterer&0 is a tool that can amass insane quantities of mana on itself, due to the amount of &1Terrasteel&0 required for its creation.<br>The tool functions very much like a &1Mana Tablet&0 by which it can amass &4Mana&0 by being tossed on a &1Mana Pool&0, it can't give the &4Mana&0 back, though, so it doesn't function as a storage method.
botania.page.terraPick1=The amount of &4Mana&0 stored on the tool defines its &4Rank&0. Ranks go as follows: &4D&0, &4C&0, &4B&0, &4A&0, &4S&0, &4SS&0. &4D&0 being the default rank.<br>The amount of &4Mana&0 required to advance from rank to rank increases as the rank does. To advance from &4D&0 to &4C&0, for example, it requires just a few seconds of exposition to a &1Mana Pool&0.
botania.page.terraPick2=To advance from rank &4C&0 to rank &4B&0, a full &1Mana Pool&0 is required, and the cost increases by a tenfold per rank from there on in, all the way to &4SS&0.<br>The rank of the tool does not change its speed, but instead, it increases the power of its &4Active Ability&0.<br>Toggling the tool's ability can be done via right click.
botania.page.terraPick3=While the tool is active, it enables it to break blocks in an extended area. At rank &4C&0 it's a small column, which increases to a square at rank &4B&0, that gets larger trough the ranks. It's to note that the rank &4D&0 tool does not have the active ability.<br>Having the tool active consumes &4Mana&0 from its storage passively, even if not being used to mine.
botania.page.terraPick4=Lastly, the tool takes damage for every single block broken, so a good supply of &4Mana&0 in the wielder's inventory is a must for the higher ranks, as the tool does function like normal &1Manasteel Tools&0, in which it'll use &4Mana&0 instead of actually taking damage, given it's made of &1Terrasteel&0.<br>It also won't despawn like regular dropped items.
botania.page.terraPick5=WE'RE MINING IN THE DATABASE WOW WOW

# -- ROD OF THE SEAS
botania.entry.waterRod=Rod of the Seas
botania.page.waterRod0=Similarly to its land counterpart, the &1Rod of the Seas&0 will, at the cost of some &4Mana&0, place down a &1Water&0 block wherever it's used on. Furthermore, it can also be used to refill a &1Petal Apothecary&0.
botania.page.waterRod1=Keep the Earth clean, it isn't Uranus

# -- ELEMENTIUM EQUIPMENT
botania.entry.elfGear=Elementium Equipment
botania.page.elfGear0=Similarly to other metals, as expected, &1Elementium&0 can, too, be shaped into tools and armor.<br>These pieces of equipment have a decent resistance to damage, about half of that of diamond, as well as the ability to drain &4Mana&0 to prevent damage.
botania.page.elfGear1=Each of the tools come with their own ability or power of sorts which makes them unique. The armor allows the wearer to, when hit, have a chance to spawn a &1Pixie&0 that goes after the attacker, dealing decent damage.<br>The more pieces of &1Elementium Armor&0 equipped, the higher the chance.
botania.page.elfGear2=Starting off, the &1Elementium Pickaxe&0 will destroy any &1Cobblestone&0, &1Dirt&0, &1Netherrack&0 and other mundane materials, leaving behind only the ores and fine resources.<br>Combining the &1Elementium Pickaxe&0 with a &1Terra Shatterer&0 in a crafting square allows for the latter to also get this power. This can't be undone.
botania.page.elfGear3=I can fit a shower in my pocket, screw cobble
botania.page.elfGear4=The &1Elementium Shovel&0 will, case the block dug is affected by gravity (&1Gravel&0, &1Sand&0, etc), dig all the blocks of that material above and/or below it, no more gravel falling while mining.
botania.page.elfGear5=Putting Things on Top of Other Things
botania.page.elfGear6=The &1Elementium Axe&0 doubles as a weapon, if used to strike the finishing blow to a &4Zombie&0, &4Skeleton&0, &4Creeper&0 or even another &4Player&0, it has a chance to decapitate them, leaving their severed head or skull behind.  
botania.page.elfGear7=Off with their heads
botania.page.elfGear8=The &1Elementium Shears&0 hold the ability to, when held back like a bow, shear any nearby sheep with speed within a large area of effect centered on the holder.
botania.page.elfGear9=Nui? She's h-arm-less
botania.page.elfGear10=Lastly, the &1Elementium Sword&0 will increase the chance of a &4Pixie&0 spawning when hit (this holds true when no &1Elementium Armor&0 is worn) and increases the strength of any &4Pixies&0 spawned.

# -- ROD OF BIFROST
botania.entry.rainbowRod=Rod of the Bifrost
botania.page.rainbowRod0=&4Bifrost&0, the rainbow bridge that reaches between the world and the realm of the gods.<br>While this item, the &1Rod of the Bifrost&0 doesn't exactly do that, it allows the holder, via a right click and at the cost of some &4Mana&0, to create a rainbow bridge in the direction he or she is looking at.
botania.page.rainbowRod1=This bridge extends as far as a hundred blocks, and will vanish after about fifteen seconds.<br>Only one bridge can be created for any given &1Rod of the Bifrost&0 at a time, as soon as the old bridge vanishes, a new one can be created.
botania.page.rainbowRod2=Going my way!! Cut open a path and go!

# -- ROD OF THE SKIES
botania.entry.tornadoRod=Rod of the Skies
botania.page.tornadoRod0=The &1Rod of the Skies&0 is a magical instrument with the ability to propel one in the air at fast velocity for the cost of some &4Mana&0.<br>To do so, one would simply hold it like a bow and watch as their momentum increases.<br>The rod takes a small amount of time to recharge, but during that time it'll block any fall damage, keeping the user safe.
botania.page.tornadoRod1=A treasure from Lorule

# -- ROD OF THE HELLS
botania.entry.fireRod=Rod of the Hells
botania.page.fireRod0=The &1Rod of the Hells&0 contains the essence of a burning flame, using it on the ground will create a circle of fire that burns anything inside it, for a decent cost of &4Mana&0.<br>The ring has a decent radius, and takes a small amount of time to fully propagate, it's to note that after that time it burns anything living in it, the caster included.
botania.page.fireRod1=Megu Megu Fire Endless Night

# -- VINE BALLS
botania.entry.vineBall=Vine Balls
botania.page.vineBall0=&1Ladders&0 can't stand up on their own, they require something on their back, whereas &1Vines&0 don't. Normally, though, &1Vines&0 aren't strong enough for someone to climb them when they're freestanding.<br>By combining a few &1Vines&0, it's possible to create a ball that can be thrown, to create a climbable ladder of strong &1Vines&0 where it hits.
botania.page.vineBall1=It's also possible, by combining some materials such as &1Livingwood&0 or a &1Rune of Air&0 to create a slingshot that lets these &1Vine Balls&0 be shot while completely ignoring the force of gravity.
botania.page.vineBall2=This would be in Vineacraft...
botania.page.vineBall3=...if that actually existed.

# -- SHARD OF LAPUTA
botania.entry.laputaShard=Shard of Laputa
botania.page.laputaShard0=Via a somewhat complex magic activation sequence, combining a few interesting resources, including &1Gaia Spirits&0 would allow one to create a shard that, when used on the ground, will lift an almost spherical area around that point up into the air.<br>This process consumes the shard and can take upwards of ten minutes depending on the mass of land.
botania.page.laputaShard2=The radius of the island creates start at 14 blocks, on other words, 28 blocks of diameter. It's possible to increase the size by upgrading the shard with additional &1Gaia Spirits&0, each one adds 1 block to the radius, or 2 to the diameter.
botania.page.laputaShard1=Look Shiro, Laputa exists!
botania.page.laputaShard3=Size does matter

# -- EQUESTRIAN VIRUS
botania.entry.virus=Equestrian Virus
botania.page.virus0=Through the mixing of some ingredients, a type of virus that can alter the genetic code of equestrian life can be made.<br>Using one of these viruses on a &1Horse&0 will alter its genetic code, turning it into either a &1Zombie&0 or &1Skeleton Horse&0. Not only will it do that, but it will vastly increase all the &1Horse&0's genetic attributes.
botania.page.virus1=No ponies here

# -- ROD OF THE HIGHLANDS
botania.entry.skyDirtRod=Rod of the Highlands
botania.page.skyDirtRod0=While the &1Rod of the Lands&0 is all well and good, being able to place &1Dirt&0 without something to hold it would be great.<br>The &1Rod of the Highlands&0 does just that, while maintaining the original power of the &1Rod of the Lands&0, it can also place &1Dirt&0 in mid air, for an increased &4Mana&0 cost.
botania.page.skyDirtRod1=Dirty Stick mk2

# -- VITREOUS PICKAXE
botania.entry.glassPick=Vitreous Pickaxe
botania.page.glassPick0=Placing down &1Glass&0 and having to break it again can be a heartbreaking experience. Luckily, by creating a &1Vitreous Pickaxe&0, one can gather the &1Glass&0 back by mining it with the pick, it's like cheap &4Silk Touch&0 for glass!

# -- ROD OF DIVINING
botania.entry.diviningRod=Rod of the Plentiful Mantle
botania.page.diviningRod0=The &1Rod of the Plentiful Mantle&0 has the ability to divine in a decently large radius around the user to find any ores. These will shine for a little bit, allowing their location.<br>This process, obviously, requires a decent amount of &4Mana&0 from the user's inventory.
botania.page.diviningRod1=inb4 ee3 

# -- ROD OF THE BLACK MESA
botania.entry.gravityRod=Rod of the Shaded Mesa
botania.page.gravityRod0=The &1Rod of the Shaded Mesa&0 is a powerful relic, legend says that the first of these devices was found atop a dark mesa, along with a crowbar.<br>To use this device, the user may right click and hold on a monster or item to pick it up. Releasing right click will drop the selected entity, while left click will fire it in a powerful burst.
botania.page.gravityRod1=This power does not come free, of course. It requires significant amounts of &4Mana&0 from the user's inventory.

# -- TIMELESS IVY
botania.entry.regenIvy=Timeless Ivy
botania.page.regenIvy0=While &1Manasteel&0 or &1Elementium&0 tools have the ability to harness &4Mana&0 and use it to protect their bodies, other tools or armor don't have this property.<br>A handful of &1Timeless Ivy&0 can be attached on to virtually any item, allowing it to be repaired with &4Mana&0.
botania.page.regenIvy1=To apply it, one'd simply craft the tool in question alongside the ivy and 3 of an item that can be used to repair the tool in an anvil (eg. &1Diamonds&0 for a &1Diamond Pickaxe&0).<br>Due to not being in direct contact with the material, the amount of &4Mana&0 used by the ivy in comparison to &1Manasteel&0 is rather high.
botania.page.regenIvy2=Bring your Inferno Adze

# -- ROD OF THE ARCANE BARRAGE
botania.entry.missileRod=Rod of the Unstable Reservoir
botania.page.missileRod0=The &1Rod of the Unstable Reservoir&0 is a rather powerful weapon against a large crowd of foes. Channeling its power will materialize countless arcane missiles that home in on targets at random, at a pretty hefty cost of &4Mana&0.

# -- ASSEMBLY HALO
botania.entry.craftingHalo=Assembly Halo
botania.page.craftingHalo0=Carrying a &1Crafting Table&0 around generally can be troublesome. The &1Assembly Halo&0 acts not only as a portable &1Crafting Table&0 but as a quick crafting method. Having the item in hand displays a "halo" of recipes around the holder.<br>First off, right clicking on the &1Crafting Table&0 will open up a crafting interface.
botania.page.craftingHalo1=As long as the item is present in the inventory the last crafting recipe done will be stored in it.<br>Right clicking an empty slot of the halo will set the last recipe on it. Right clicking a slot with a recipe will try to do it using items from the inventory. Removing a recipe can be done through shift-left click.
botania.page.craftingHalo2=It has no taste if you cook it from the menu

# -- LENS CLIP
botania.entry.clip=Lens Clip
botania.page.clip0=While a formidable and versatile tool, the &1Mana Blaster&0's greatest downfall is the lack of an ability to store more than one &1Lens&0 at once. Not any more. The &1Lens Clip&0 will attach to a &1Mana Blaster&0 in a crafting grid and allow it to store up to 6 lenses rather than just one.<br>As they say, Russian Roulette is not the same without a gun...
botania.page.clip1=Adding and removing &1Lenses&0 works just as it did previously, with one detail. The lens will be added or removed in the slot that the clip is currently on.<br>To change this slot, simply shift-right click the &1Mana Blaster&0 in the air. This will also change which lens is selected, case there is one in that slot.
botania.page.clip2=Since we're dubbed by 4Kids we must make do without one

# -- ROD OF THE DEPTHS
botania.entry.cobbleRod=Rod of the Depths

# -- ROD OF THE MOLTEN CORE
botania.entry.smeltRod=Rod of the Molten Core
botania.page.smeltRod0=The &1Rod of the Molten Core&0 has the ability to expel heat provenient from the world's core. Holding it via right click and pointing at a block in the world that can be smelted into a different type of block will quickly turn it into that.<br>For some examples, &1Cobblestone&0 turns into &1Stone&0, &1Sand&0 into &1Glass&0, so on.
botania.page.smeltRod1=Stolen from Efreet

# -- WORLD SEED
botania.entry.worldSeed=World Seed
botania.page.worldSeed0=The &1World Seed&0 is a piece of elemental energized matter containing the ability to return its user to the world spawn.<br>Case the person who is using it is farther than 24 blocks from the world's spawn point, using the seed, via right click, will instantly teleport them there, consuming the seed.

# -- SPELLBINDING CLOTH
botania.entry.spellCloth=Spellbinding Cloth
botania.page.spellCloth0=Combining &1Wool&0 with some &4Mana&0 in the form of a &1Mana Pearl&0 allows for one to create a type of cloth that will absorb any &4Enchantments&0 it comes in contact with.<br>Combining the &1Spellbinding Cloth&0 with any enchanted item in a crafting table will remove all enchants from that item at the cost of some of the cloth's durability.
botania.page.spellCloth1=Oldest item in the book

# -- THORN CHAKRAM
botania.entry.thornChakram=Thorn Chakram
botania.page.thornChakram0=The &1Thorn Chakram&0 is a thrown weapon made of &1Terrasteel&0 and plant matter. After thrown it'll pierce through enemies, damaging them and sometimes poisoning them, and bounce on blocks a few times before returning to the thrower, similarly to a boomerang.
botania.page.thornChakram1=Spores and stingers

# -- OVERGROWTH SEED
botania.entry.overgrowthSeed=Overgrowth Seed
botania.page.overgrowthSeed0=An &1Overgrowth Seed&0 is an elusive item, which can be used to enchant a piece of &1Grass&0, via right clicking on it in the world, creating &1Enchanted Soil&0. Flowers that are rooted on this &1Enchanted Soil&0 will function at double the normal speed.<br>There's one problem, though. No known method of creating these exists, but they have been spotted in ancient structures and the like.

# -- LIVINGWOOD BOW
botania.entry.livingwoodBow=Livingwood Bow
botania.page.livingwoodBow0=The &1Livingwood Bow&0 is, as the name describes, a bow made of &1Livingwood&0 strung with &1Mana Infused String&0. Due to its componenets, it will last for longer than a normal &1Bow&0. It'll also repair itself using &4Mana&0, similarly to &1Manasteel Tools&0.
botania.page.livingwoodBow1=Does it shoot airplanes?

# -- CRYSTAL BOW
botania.entry.crystalBow=Crystal Bow
botania.page.crystalBow0=Crafted with &1Dragonstone&0, the &1Crystal Bow&0 is a ranged weapon with the capacity to generate arrows from &4Mana&0. Similarly to the &1Livingwood Bow&0, it'll repair using &4Mana&0 as well, but carrying &1Arrows&0 is not required as they are created through the magical energies.<br>Given the lightweight and flexible structure of the bow, it can also fire at a much increased velocity than a conventional wooden one.
botania.page.crystalBow1=The elves are roving

# - ENDER ARTEFACTS
# -- EXTRACTING ENDER AIR
botania.entry.enderAir=Extracting Ender Air
botania.page.enderAir0=The air present in the void of the &1End&0 seems to have some mutating properties. Right clicking with an empty &1Glass Bottle&0 while in the &1End&0 will capture some of that air, which can then later be tossed similarly to a splash potion, turning nearby &1Stone&0 on the landing point into &1End Stone&0. 

# -- ENDER OVERSEER
botania.entry.enderEyeBlock=Ender Overseer
botania.page.enderEyeBlock0=The eyes of an &4Enderman&0 have an interesting sensitivity to being watched. A block out of these will simply output a &4redstone signal&0 if a player within a 64 block radius is looking directly at it.<br>Of course, wearing a &1Pumpkin&0 negates this effect.
botania.page.enderEyeBlock1=MY BRAND

# -- FORCE RELAY
botania.entry.pistonRelay=Force Relay
botania.page.pistonRelay0=It seems that infusing &1Pistons&0 with &4Mana&0 results in some interesting adverse effects.<br>This block tears the fabric of space, relaying any piston force applied to it to the block it's bound to.
botania.page.pistonRelay1=To bind it to a block, right click it with a &1Wand of the Forest&0, and right click on the block you want to bind it to.<br>Furthermore, this block is highly unstable, and may create uncanny effects, care is to be taken, it is also resistant to glue, both in pulling and pushing. This allows for a "frame" like setup.
botania.page.pistonRelay2=Infusing a &1Piston&0 with &4Mana&0.

# -- HAND OF ENDER
botania.entry.enderHand=Hand of Ender
botania.page.enderHand0=The &1Hand of Ender&0 allows the user to access the interdimensional ender field, on other words, their &1Ender Chest&0 inventory. This can be done anywhere by right clicking with the hand at the cost of some &4Mana&0.<br>Using the hand on another player will open up &otheir&r inventory instead, at a lot higher &4Mana&0 cost.
botania.page.enderHand0a=The &1Hand of Ender&0 allows the user to access the interdimensional ender field, on other words, their &1Ender Chest&0 inventory. This can be done anywhere by right clicking with the hand at the cost of some &4Mana&0.

# -- SOULSCRIBE
botania.entry.enderDagger=Soulscribe
botania.page.enderDagger0=Those &4Endermen&0. They're the second more pesky thing since &4Creepers&0. I swear, the person who came up with them must have taken a &onotch&r too much of their drink.<br>However, by infusing a standard dagger with some of their energy, one can create the &1Soulscribe&0, a dagger that tears through &1Endermen&0 as if they were butter.
botania.page.enderDagger1=Due of the type of infusion, though, the dagger only lasts for a few kills, and the energy that radiates from it prevents the &1Manasteel&0 from gathering &4Mana&0 to avoid damage, like typical tools would. Still, all in the name of killing those monsters.
botania.page.enderDagger2=Strike my Soul

# -- LIFE IMBUER
botania.entry.spawnerClaw=Life Imbuer
botania.page.spawnerClaw0=&1Monster Spawners&0 are an interesting bunch. They have the ability to bring out life from thin air, but somehow, this only manifests when there's a player nearby.<br>This, of course, tends to be a rather limiting factor in the onslaught of any creatures that they can create.
botania.page.spawnerClaw1=By placing a &1Life Imbuer&0 on top of a &1Monster Spawner&0 and giving it a rather decent chunk of &4Mana&0 through a &1Mana Spreader&0, when there aren't any players in the nearby vicinity, the &4Mana&0 will power the spawner, just as if there were players around.
botania.page.spawnerClaw2=Something something shadow dragon

# -- RED STRING
botania.entry.redString=Red String
botania.page.redString0=Lore says the Gods tie a red string around the ankles of people who are supposed to affect each others lives. This led inventors to come up with a way of connecting blocks over the air, called, of course, &1Red String&0. Blocks created with this exquisite material can face in all 6 basic directions and bind to the first available and compatible block they can find, given a range.
botania.page.redString1=Each &4Red Stringed&0 block has a different criteria to what it'll bind to, but the distance in which they'll bind stays constant between the variations. The string can be viewed, if a block is bound, by holding a &1Wand of the Forest&0.<br>Blocks being in the way will not break the connection. Lastly, &1Red String&0 blocks can't be chained.
botania.page.redString2=Are you in a pinch?
botania.page.redString3=Starting off, the &1Red Stringed Container&0 will bind to any inventory (&1Chests&0, &1Furnaces&0, &1Hoppers&0, etc), items can be put into it using &1Hoppers&0 or any other means of insertion. The items will end up in the block it's bound to, and will enter from the same side as they were put on the &1Red Stringed Container&0 itself.
botania.page.redString4=The &1Red Stringed Container&0.
botania.page.redString5=The &1Red Stringed Dispenser&0 can be bound to &1Dispensers&0 or &1Droppers&0, it functions similarly to the &1Red Stringed Container&0 where items can also be placed in the bound block through it. When a redstone signal is given to it, the &1Dispenser&0 or &1Dropper&0 in the end will fire.
botania.page.redString6=The &1Red Stringed Dispenser&0.
botania.page.redString7=The &1Red Stringed Nutrifier&0 can be bound to any block that can be fertilized with &1Bone Meal&0. Using &1Bone Meal&0 on the block will fertilize the bound block instead.
botania.page.redString8=The &1Red Stringed Nutrifier&0.
botania.page.redString9=The &1Red Stringed Comparator&0 can be bound to any block whose status can be read with a &1Container&0, such as &1Chests&0, &1Mana Pools&0, &1Runic Altars&0, etc. Placing a &1Comparator&0 pointing outwards of this block will send the signal equal to the signal a &1Comparator&0 would send on the bound block.
botania.page.redString10=The &1Red Stringed Comparator&0.
botania.page.redString11=Lastly, the &1Red Stringed Spoofer&0 is an interesting one. Any flower with an effect can be placed on it. The block will bind to any flowers or mushrooms. While there's a flower on top of the block, that flower will not do anything, but the bound block will take all of that flower's properties and work as if it was the flower itself.
botania.page.redString12=The &1Red Stringed Spoofer&0.

# -- FLUGEL TIARA
botania.entry.flightTiara=Flügel Tiara
botania.page.flightTiara0=The &4Flügel&0 were once a dominant species in the lands, now they're but a race past extinct, once created as godslayers, who possessed the ability of flight.<br>The usage of &1Gaia Spirits&0 allows for a small replica of their power, in the form of the &1Flügel Tiara&0, which, at the cost of &4Mana&0 allows for flight.
botania.page.flightTiara1=Forty thousand books from another world
botania.page.flightTiara2=Combining the Tiara with a variety of Quartz species allows for it to create various different kinds of aesthetic wings, one for each style of quartz.<br>The recipes for the various types of quartz can be found in the &4Decorative Blocks&0 entry under &4Misclaneous&0, &1Elven Quartz&0 is acquired by trading &1Nether Quartz&0 with the elves.
botania.page.flightTiara3=Adding Wings (they can be swapped any time)

# -- BASICS OF CORPOREA
botania.entry.corporea=Basics of Corporea
botania.page.corporea0=&4Corporea&0 is a magical system that utilizes the energy of the end and the empty space in the world to transport items from point A to point B instantly and without any connecting parts.<br>The system works through a variant of &1Sparks&0, &1Corporea Sparks&0. These share some similarities with normal &1Sparks&0 but also a fair few differences.
botania.page.corporea1=Starting off, they can go on top of any &4Inventory&0, like a &1Chest&0 or a &1Dispenser&0 as opposed to &4Mana Containers&0, secondly, there's two types of &1Corporea Sparks&0, the basic &1Corporea Spark&0 and the &1Master Corporea Spark&0. These sparks work in a network-like system, each &1Master Corporea Spark&0 designates a &4Corporea Network&0, in which any spark can communicate with other sparks present in it.
botania.page.corporea2=When a &1Corporea Spark&0 is placed or polled, each spark will poll any nearby sparks, adding them to the network designated by the single &1Master Corporea Spark&0 and also polling other nearby sparks, in a chain. While each individual spark can only reach a few blocks, combined, the entire network can go for a virtually infinite distance.
botania.page.corporea3=&1Corporea Sparks&0 have a view of the inventory directly below them, but can only access items from the top side. Each &1Corporea Spark&0 has the ability to view every other spark in the network and its contents, and the ability to request them as necessary, depending on the type of block below it.
botania.page.corporea4=It's to note that the &1Master Corporea Spark&0, while being part of the network, can not have the items in its inventory extracted from.<br>Futhermore, no requests for items in the network are ever done passively. Corporea does not have the ability to add new items to the network, those should be inserted physically through &1Hoppers&0 or other methods.
botania.page.corporea5=Similarly to normal &1Sparks&0, &1Corporea Sparks&0 have a method of augmentation, that being the ability to color them. While in the world, there's an icon floating around the spark that shows which color it has, this can be changed by right clicking on the spark with a piece of &1Floral Powder&0. These colors define networks. A spark may only be in the same network as another spark if the two have the same color. 
botania.page.corporea6=The ability to color sparks allows for multiple different &4Corporea Networks&0 to be together in a close area, without interfering with each other.<br>Viewing the network and removing the spark works exactly the same as a normal spark. Lastly, having two &1Master Corporea Sparks&0 of the same color nearby, while possible, is a bad idea and will cause conflicts and odd behaviour.
botania.page.corporea7=Creating &1Corporea Sparks&0
botania.page.corporea8=And &1Master Corporea Sparks&0

# -- CORPOREA INDEX
botania.entry.corporeaIndex=Corporea Index
botania.page.corporeaIndex0=The biggest ability of a &4Corporea Network&0 is the ability to vocally request items from it by name. The &1Corporea Index&0 is an ender-crystal like block that can interface with a given &4Corporea Network&0 by having a &1Corporea Spark&0 placed on top of it.<br>While in the world, approaching it will cause it to activate and show the radius in which it will stay activated.
botania.page.corporeaIndex1=While activated, the index will intercept any &4Chat Messages&0 sent by nearby players, taking them in as &4requests&0 and preventing them to be broadcasted to chat. From this, it'll request, from the network, items whose name matches the request. For example, writing "iron ingot" will have the index look through the network for a single &1Iron Ingot&0 and transport it towards itself, materializing it in the world.
botania.page.corporeaIndex2=Requests can be more complex than just a single item. For example "10 apples" will request, as described, 10 &1Apples&0. Writing "this" will search for items whose name equals the name of the item in the player's hand. Prepending or appending to a query "...", "~", "+" or "?" will turn it into a "contains" rather than "equals" query. So writing "iron..." will find all items that have "iron" in their name, for example.
botania.page.corporeaIndex3=The plural form of an item's name may only be used case it's a regular noun when it comes to the plural (suffixed by "-s", "-es" or "-ies"), the singular version works just as well for requests of multiple items, such as "10 apple".<br>"10 of this" requests 10 items whose name equals the item in the player's hand, as expected.
botania.page.corporeaIndex4=Examples of complex requests include "10 apples", "a stack of apples", "2 stacks of apples", "2 stacks and 20 apples", "half a stack of apples", "a dozen apples", and so on.<br>The index will also recognise more or less verbose forms of request, so "2x stacks and 20x of apples" is equal to "2 stack 2 apple" or "2 stacks + 2 apples".
botania.page.corporeaIndex5=Requesting with "all" or "every" will deliver every single item in the network that matches the criteria, so "all apples" will deliver all the apples in the network.<br>On the other side, requesting "count", "show", "display" or "tell" won't request any, but will tell the requester how many exist in the network.
botania.page.corporeaIndex6=A certain magical one at that

# -- CORPOREA FUNNEL
botania.entry.corporeaFunnel=Corporea Funnel
botania.page.corporeaFunnel0=A simpler block that utilizes the prospects of the &4Corporea Network&0 is the &1Corporea Funnel&0, when given access to a network through a &1Corporea Spark&0 on top, it'll pull a single item from the network when given a redstone signal.<br>This item is put into an inventory 1 or 2 blocks below it, or case one doesn't exist or is full, tossed into the world right above the funnel.
botania.page.corporeaFunnel1=The &1Corporea Funnel&0 may only pull items that match its filter, similarly to a &1Hopperhock&0, the filter is designated by items contained on &1Item Frames&0 placed on it. The item pulled is one of the various items in the frames at random.
botania.page.corporeaFunnel2=Energistically applied

# -- DECORATIVE END BLOCKS
botania.entry.endStoneDecor=Decorative End Blocks
botania.page.endStoneDecor0=Similarly to other stone blocks, &1End Stone&0 can be converted into bricks and chiseled bricks, the bricks can be used as stairs or slabs just like normal &1Stone Bricks&0 would.

botania.page.endStoneDecor2=Making &1Chiseled End Stone Bricks&0

# -- LIFE AGGREGATOR
botania.entry.spawnerMover=Life Aggregator
botania.page.spawnerMover0=By arranging &1Dragonstone&0, &1Elementium&0 and &1Gaia Spirits&0 in a specific pattern, one can create a device that can contain the curious energies of a &1Monster Spawner&0 and materialize it in another point in space.<br>It's to note that the device will shatter after being used once.
botania.page.spawnerMover1=We got the spawner, but this isn't a won run yet

# -- RESOLUTE IVY
botania.entry.keepIvy=Resolute Ivy
botania.page.keepIvy0=Everyone knows that before being ressurected, one's items splatter all over the ground, generally a massive nuisance. The fix for this is rather simple. By attaching a piece of &1Resolute Ivy&0 to an item through a crafting grid, that item will presist on one's inventory through death. The ivy will degenerate after that fact and will need to be applied again if one wishes to have the item survive another downfall.
botania.page.keepIvy1=Because people die when they are killed

# -- BLACK HOLE TALISMAN
botania.entry.blackHoleTalisman=Black Hole Talisman
botania.page.blackHoleTalisman0=The void is a massive space full of... void, really. There's nothing there. But with some ingenuity, this space can be used to store items to your heart's content.<br>The &1Black Hole Talisman&0 utilizes powerful Gaia and Ender magic to allow for a virtually infinite quantity of a single type of block to be stored in this space.
botania.page.blackHoleTalisman1=Right clicking a block in the world will set the talisman to store that type of block. This can only be done if the talisman is empty. Next off, shift-right clicking the talisman in the air will enable or disable it. Whilst enabled and in the user's inventory it'll absorb any blocks of the type into it.<br>Placing the item in a crafting grid allows one to extract stacks of the blocks in it.
botania.page.blackHoleTalisman2=While the talisman has any contents in it, the blocks in it can be placed as if they were normal blocks stored in the inventory via a simple right click with it.<br>Right clicking an inventory will try to fill it with the blocks stored in the talisman.
botania.page.blackHoleTalisman3=Like a Rageki but twice as fun

# -- AN INTRODUCTION TO BAUBLES
botania.entry.bIntro=An Introduction to Baubles
botania.page.bIntro0=&4Baubles&0, also commonly referred to as &4Trinkets&0 or &4Charms&0 are pieces of equipment which offer all sorts of different effects, when worn.<br>To equip them, one can press the &4B&0 (configurable) key. There's four slots, one &4Amulet&0 slot, two &4Ring&0 slots and one &4Belt&0 slot.
botania.page.bIntro1=The &4Baubles Screen&0
botania.page.bIntro2=It's to note that, if &4Thaumcraft&0 or any other mod that uses the baubles system is installed, this inventory will be shared between the various mods. 

# -- COSMETIC BAUBLES
botania.entry.cosmeticBaubles=Cosmetic Baubles
botania.page.cosmeticBaubles0=A large selection of &1Cosmetic Baubles&0 is available to change or add style to any baubles a player has equipped. These can both be worn by themselves, on the amulet slot, or crafted alongside another &4Bauble&0 in a crafting grid to change the look of the bauble to the new &4Cosmetic Override&0. Removing &4Cosmetic Overrides&0 can be done through putting the bauble back in the crafting grid.
botania.page.cosmeticBaubles1=Creating these is done through an interesting method, weaving a specific color of petal around some &1Mana Infused String&0 creates an item. The type of item created doesn't seem to have anything to do with the color.<br>How this works really isn't too well known, it's like the person that came up with this didn't bother to use better materials or something, who knows.

# -- TINY PLANET
botania.entry.tinyPlanet=Tiny Planet
botania.page.tinyPlanet0=The &1Tiny Planet&0 is a &4Bauble&0 with gravitational proprieties, while equipped, the &1Tiny Planet&0 will pull any nearby &4Mana Bursts&0 towards the wearer, having them orbit around him or her.<br>By increasing its mass with some &1Stone&0, it can also be placed in world, for the same effect.

# -- BAND OF MANA
botania.entry.manaRing=Band of Mana
botania.page.manaRing0=Combining a &1Mana Tablet&0 with some &1Manasteel&0 creates an easily worn &4Ring&0, that functions exactly similar to the tablet used to make it, but can be worn as a &4Bauble&0.<br>Using some &1Terrasteel&0 allows for an upgrade, which lets it store about four times as much &4Mana&0.

botania.page.manaRing2=Upgrading the ring

# -- BAND OF AURA
botania.entry.auraRing=Band of Aura
botania.page.auraRing0=The &1Band of Aura&0 is a bit of a deviation from the typical &1Band of Mana&0, in which, instead of storing &4Mana&0, it slowly, while equipped, creates it and stores it into &4Mana&0 containing items in the wearer's inventory.<br>Using some &1Terrasteel&0 allows for an upgrade, which lets it generate &4Mana&0 at a significantly faster rate.

# -- SOUJOURNER'S SASH
botania.entry.travelBelt=Soujourner's Sash
botania.page.travelBelt0=Traversing terrain sometimes proves to be a hassle. The &1Soujourner's Sash&0 can be equipped in the &4Belt&0 slot, and when worn will increase the movement speed, jump height and resistance to fall damage of the wearer.<br>Lastly, if not sneaking, it also allows the wearer to walk over 1 block high gaps without jumping with ease.
botania.page.travelBelt1=...everell

# -- TECTONIC GIRDLE
botania.entry.knockbackBelt=Tectonic Girdle
botania.page.knockbackBelt0=By harnessing the forces of tectonic movement, the &1Tectonic Girdle&0, when worn, will negate any &4Knockback&0 applied to the wearer by outside attacks.
botania.page.knockbackBelt1=I'm the man who can't be moved

# -- SNOWFLAKE PENDANT
botania.entry.icePendant=Snowflake Pendant
botania.page.icePendant0=The &1Snowflake Pendant&0 is a &4Bauble&0 that resonates freezing energy, while it's worn, any nearby still &1Water&0 blocks at foot level will be converted into &1Ice&0.<br>The &1Ice&0 will melt shortly afterward the wearer leaves the area. Lastly, this charm will not freeze any blocks if the wearer is sneaking or fully submerged.  
botania.page.icePendant1=Do you want to build a snowman?

# -- PYROCLAST PENDANT
botania.entry.lavaPendant=Pyroclast Pendant
botania.page.lavaPendant0=The &1Pyroclast Pendant&0 is a &4Bauble&0 that absorbs low heat, while it's worn, if the wearer is caught on fire and is not directly standing on &1Fire&0, &1Lava&0 or anything else that can induce burning, they'll be extinguished.
botania.page.lavaPendant1=Hanako could have used one of these

botania.page.goldenLaurel0=One of the uses for &1Gaia Spririts&0 is to, grant a layer of immortality to one that uses them, while wearing a &1Golden Laurel Crown&0, if the wearer were to die, the crown will shatter, regenerating all of their health and giving them a short period of invincibility.
botania.page.goldenLaurel1=Given the theme, probably Viridi

# -- RING OF CHORDATA
botania.entry.waterRing=Ring of Chordata
botania.page.waterRing0=The &1Ring of Chordata&0 allows the wearer to swim like a fish. While it's equipped, the wearer is bestowed with the ability to accelerate to a decent speed while underwater. It also gives the wearer good sight underwater and, if &4Mana&0 is present, at the cost of some of it, the ability to breathe indefinitely.
botania.page.waterRing1=Check out that fish AI

# -- RING OF THE MANTLE
botania.entry.miningRing=Ring of the Mantle
botania.page.miningRing0=The &1Ring of the Mantle&0 allows one to mine faster, while equipped and &4Mana&0 is present in the inventory, it'll give a &4Haste&0 effect to the wearer. Some &4Mana&0 is used while the wearer swings their arm or equipped item, be it for attacking, mining or just flailing.
botania.page.miningRing1=Diggy diggy hole

# -- RING OF MAGNETIZATION
botania.entry.magnetRing=Ring of Magnetization
botania.page.magnetRing0=By turning a &1Magnetizing Lens&0 into a wearable ring, one can use it to magnetize nearby items. While equipped, this ring will make any nearby items magnetize towards the wearer if they're not sneaking. A notable feature of this piece is that it'll negate its effect for 5 seconds after the wearer tosses an item so as to not interfere with whatever means it was tossed for. A &1Solegnolia&0 can disrupt this ring's functionality.
botania.page.magnetRing1=How do they work?

# -- RING OF FAR REACH
botania.entry.reachRing=Ring of Far Reach
botania.page.reachRing0=Through the power of one's Pride, nothing is out of their reach. By wearing the &1Ring of Far Reach&0, the maximum distance the wearer can break, place or interact with blocks, as well as attack or interact with entities is increased by about three blocks.
botania.page.reachRing1=Fire and Blood

# -- CHARM OF THE DIVA
botania.entry.divaCharm=Charm of the Diva
botania.page.divaCharm0=The &1Charm of the Diva&0 blesses the wearer with the ability to have any attacked mob follow the attacker's will, and, case there are any nearby enemies, go after them instead. This process, of course, requires a bit of &4Mana&0 from the wearer's inventory in order to function.
botania.page.divaCharm1=You shall not disrespect Big Sister

# -- GREAT FAIRY RING
botania.entry.pixieRing=Great Fairy Ring
botania.page.pixieRing0=This ring works alongside the &1Elementium Armor&0, insight in the powers of it is advised before using this ring. When worn, the &1Great Fairy Ring&0 will increase the chance for a &4Pixie&0 to spawn when the wearer is hit, this still holds true case no &1Elementium Armor&0 is equipped.

# -- GLOBETROTTER'S SASH
botania.entry.superTravelBelt=Globetrotter's Sash
botania.page.superTravelBelt0=The &1Globetrotter's Sash&0 is, in layman's terms, an upgrade to then &1Soujourner's Sash&0, by using &1Gaia Spirits&0 and some Elven resources, this new belt allows the wearer to reach incredible speeds to which the &1Soujourner's Sash&0 doesn't stand a chance.
botania.page.superTravelBelt1=No time for guessing, follow my plan instead

# -- THE SPECTATOR
botania.entry.itemFinder=The Spectator
botania.page.itemFinder0=&1The Spectator&0 is a headband that allows the wearer to have a better perception of the world.

botania.page.itemFinder1=&o(...)&r &4players&0 who have the item in their inventory and &4villagers&0 who want to trade either with or for that item will shine with a colorful glow, allowing them to be easily spotted.<br>While sneaking, all dropped items around the wearer will shine, regardless of the item.
botania.page.itemFinder2=Do you hear their voices?

# -- CRIMSON PENDANT
botania.entry.superLavaPendant=Crimson Pendant
botania.page.superLavaPendant0=The &1Crimson Pendant&0 is, in simple terms, an upgraded counterpart to the &1Pyroclast Pendant&0, wearing it provides the wearer immunity to all fire and lava damage, instead of just extinguishing them.
botania.page.superLavaPendant1=Runner-up on Monolith Code

# -- TAINTED BLOOD PENDANT
botania.entry.bloodPendant=Tainted Blood Pendant
botania.page.bloodPendant0=Messing around with the original source of the &4Potion&0 design, the Nether, seems to work fairly well at harnessing that very power.<br>The &1Tainted Blood Pendant&0 allows one to store a &4Brew&0 in a condensed, wearable state. Infusing this pendant with one and wearing it will apply the effect while it's worn, for the cost of &4Mana&0 depending on the power of the &4Brew&0.
botania.page.bloodPendant1=To infuse the pendant with a &4Brew&0 the normal procedure of infusing one on a &1Vial&0 is what's required. The cost increases by a tenfold, though.<br>However, the pendant will not accept any and all effects, a few don't seem to behave well, such as &4Instant Health&0 or &4Absorption&0. Lastly, &4Brews&0 with more than one effect will fail as well.

# -- CLOAKS OF JUDGEMENT
botania.entry.judgementCloaks=Cloaks of Judgement
botania.page.judgementCloaks0=The &1Cloaks of Judgement&0 are a pair of cloaks that can be worn instead of a belt (and thus, they go in the Belt slot). Their strength triggers when their wearer takes damage. After that, they'll go in a ten second recharge period in which their effects won't trigger.
botania.page.judgementCloaks1=The &1Cloak of Virtue&0 will, when active, block the full extent of a piece of damage taken. This does not apply to magic damage.<br>The &1Cloak of Sin&0 will damage all nearby hostile mobs for the same amount of damage that was taken.

# -- MANASEER MONOCLE
botania.entry.monocle=Manaseer Monocle
botania.page.monocle0=A handy acessory for one who requires a thorough window into where their &4Mana Bursts&0 are going is the &1Manaseer Monocle&0. Not only is it a rather fancy eyepiece but it also allows the wearer to see all nearby &4Mana Bursts&0, even if their line of sight towards them is blocked by something. More important, perhaps, is that when someone wearing this monocle looks at a flower they'll be able to see its functional radius.

# -- RING OF CORRECTION
botania.entry.swapRing=Ring of Correction
botania.page.swapRing0=Switching tools is a pain. People often find themselves shoveling away at dirt with... a pick? Using the &1Ring of Correction&0 is a great way to, well, correct that.<br>While this ring is worn, the tool in hand will always be the right one for the block being broken, be it a pick, axe or shovel.

Due to unknown events, they would've been banished back to their own world, &4Alfheim&0.<br>Experimentation has been done in atempt to bridge the gap between the two worlds, and means of creating a portal that does just that have been devised.
botania.page.aIntro1=Creating this portal proves not to be an easy task, as quite a few exquisite resources are necessary. The requirements are as follows: 8 &1Livingwood&0 blocks, 3 &1Glimmering Livingwood&0 blocks, 1 &1Elven Gateway Core&0 (read on), 2 &1Mana Pools&0 and 2 &1Natura Pylons&0 (read on).

botania.page.aIntro8=Place &1Natura Pylons&0 above the pools
botania.page.aIntro9=To open up the portal, simply right click the core with a &1Wand of the Forest&0.<br>The portal requires a substantial amount of &4Mana&0 deposited in both the pools to open up, after that, it'll slowly drain some to keep itself powered. If it runs out of &4Mana&0, the connection will be broken.
botania.page.aIntro10=The amount of &4Mana&0 required to open up the portal is orders of magnitude higher than that to keep it maintained, thus closing the portal to prevent &4Mana&0 loss is a poor strategy.<br>Furthermore, the link isn't strong enough to allow living beings to go through it, but it seems that &4items&0 can.
botania.page.aIntro11=The amount of information about &1Alfheim&0 stored in this lexicon is limited to this entry alone. Perhaps &4letting the Elves have a look at it&0 might prove beneficial.<br>Perhaps they'd also return a good amount of knowledge of their mystical constructs.

# ^ This is blank on purpose
botania.page.elfMessage1=&oGreetings. We noticed that our portal was opened via a link from another world. That's rather shocking news indeed. We thank you very much for providing us with a repository of the knowledge from your world, as to keep us up to date to what happened since we left it, it's been a while since then, it's good to see it's doing well.
botania.page.elfMessage2=&oAfter some discussion with the high council of Elven Garde, we have decided to cooperate with you. You see, reading through your "Lexica Botania" has shown us a good amount of resources from your world that we would be extremely keen as to get our hands on, as these are non-existent in our lands.
botania.page.elfMessage3=&oThe link you have managed to establish is rather weak, no living beings will be able to go through, as you already know. However, there's a positive side to this, the link strikes the fabric of time of both our worlds in a way where it doesn't keep them in sync, that's the reason why you received your book back so quickly.
botania.page.elfMessage4=&oWhen it comes to Mana and other magical energies, we are plenty stocked on them, so worry not about the portal closing on our end. Let's put this in prospect, in order for the advance of both our civilizations, we vow to accept a given set of resources from your world we lack in ours in exchange for resources you lack in yours.
botania.page.elfMessage5=&oWe have taken the liberty of assigning our best scribes to put together a great set of knowledge from our world we're willing to share, you can find it in your lexicon just as you'd find knowledge from yours. We hope you find it enlightening and that it encourages you to invest in our materials.
botania.page.elfMessage6=&oLast but not least, do keep in mind that if you decide to send something we have not vouched to trade for, we will assume it as a gift and keep it for ourselves, just as a forewarning. We look forward to exchanging resources with you.<br>Best Regards, the High Council of Elven Garde.

# -- THE RESOURCES OF ALFHEIM
botania.entry.elfResources=The Resources of Alfheim
botania.page.elfResources0=&4Alfheim&0 contains a very varied amount of exquisite resources. Sadly though, most of them are extremely scarce and hard to come by due to competition between the various clans. The elves are interested in trading some materials, such as &1Dreamwood&0, &1Elementium&0, &1Pixie Dust&0 or &1Dragonstone&0, resources native to their lands. 
botania.page.elfResources1=Trading for &1Dreamwood&0
botania.page.elfResources2=&1Dreamwood&0, similarly to &1Livingwood&0 can be turned into various &4Decorative Blocks&0, have a look through the &4Decorative Blocks&0 entry under &4Miscelaneous&0 for the recipes.
botania.page.elfResources10=&1Dreamwood Twigs&0
botania.page.elfResources3=Trading for &1Elementium&0
botania.page.elfResources4=Trading for &1Pixie Dust&0
botania.page.elfResources5=Trading for &1Dragonstone&0
botania.page.elfResources6=The &1Elves&0 are also quite keen on the white posh block from the &4Nether&0, &1Nether Quartz&0, the ones they have on their world are tinted green. This quartz works just like any other quartz, be it normal &1Nether Quartz&0 or any of the decorative variants you can find on the &4Decorative Blocks&0 entry under &4Miscelaneous&0.
botania.page.elfResources7=Trading for &1Elven Quartz&0
botania.page.elfResources8=Alfheim also has its own variant of &1Glass&0, in the form of &1Alfglass&0. Its look is rather light and its patterns are randomized depending on where it's placed.<br>Trading goes for &1Managlass&0.
botania.page.elfResources9=Trading for &1Alfglass&0

# -- RITUAL OF GAIA
botania.entry.gaiaRitual=Ritual of Gaia
botania.page.gaiaRitual0=The &4Ritual of Gaia&0 is a procedure often enacted by the elves, which is the only way to acquire &1Gaia Spirits&0, which are essences of the power of the Goddess of Gaia herself.<br>This ritual required an &4Active&0 &1Beacon&0 with some &1Gaia Pylons&0 (read on) one level above the beacon as the altar, as well as a single &1Terrasteel Ingot&0 as a sacrifice.
botania.page.gaiaRitual1=Creating &1Gaia Pylons&0
botania.page.gaiaRitual2=Place the pylons (1 block above the beacon)
botania.page.gaiaRitual3=To start the ritual, simply shift-right click the &1Beacon&0 block with a &1Terrasteel Ingot&0, take a step back and prepare to fight for your life. Good preparation is required, as the fight with the &4Guardian of Gaia&0 can be even harder than that of the &4Wither&0. Upon defeating the &4Guardian&0, one can collect their prize, a handful of &1Spirits of Gaia&0.
botania.page.gaiaRitual4=The common attire for this ritual is a set of Enchanted &1Elementium Armor&0, a &1Terra Blade&0 and a large assortment of &4Brews&0 and &4Baubles&0.<br>The effect of the &1Beacon&0 is nullified during the battle, so that should be taken in mind. Lastly, staying away from the purple might be a good idea. 

# -- RITUAL OF GAIA II
botania.entry.gaiaRitualHardmode=Ritual of Gaia II
botania.page.gaiaRitualHardmode0=One would think that combining two of the most powerful resources known to existance, in the form of &1Terrasteel&0 and &1Gaia Spirits&0 would create an unstoppable material. It seems that the material is very much stoppable, though. In fact, the two forces cancel eachother out when combined into an ingot, creating an utterly useless alloy.
botania.page.gaiaRitualHardmode1=This ingot, though, due to the concentrated energy and power in it, does allow for the summoning of a stronger &1Gaia Guardian&0, with more resistance, strength and speed.<br>For all of this, it also drops more &1Gaia Spirits&0 than normal, as well as a handful of goodies and rare treasure, making it a worthwhile foe.
botania.page.gaiaRitualHardmode2=Creating the &1Gaia Spirit Ingot&0.

# -- THE RELICS OF THE AESIR
botania.entry.relics=The Relics of the Aesir
botania.page.relics0=There's an old tale from the high clans of Alfheim. It says something among the lines of "The one who rolls the Dice of Fate is to be rewarded with the Gifts of the Gods". These so called &1Relics of the Aesir&0 are rumored to be unique and soulbound, by which only one will ever be awarded to any one individual and only they might use it.<br>But then again, it's probably just folklore.

# -- ELVEN LORE - THE SHATTERING
botania.entry.elvenLore=Elven Lore - The Shattering
botania.page.elvenLore0=It seems this section of the lexicon is just a bunch of pieces of paper. By the looks of them, they seem like they were taken from a document from the libraries of Elven Garde.<br>Their contents should contain historical knowledge, but doubtfully anything important to the studies of botany itself.
botania.page.elvenLore1=&oA few millennia have passed since The Shattering. The amount of us who actually know about what really happened that day is rather minute. Nidavellir broke down, and while the Dwarves' incredible resistance helped, a great part of their technology and civilization was eradicated. Muspelheim, what was (...)

There's theories that state Hel was also involved in the event, although none were ever confirmed. Fissures in the ground of (...)
botania.page.elvenLore3=&oJotunheim opened all around, massacring a great portion of the Giants who lived there, its current status remains unknown. Niflheim seemed to stay in place, unlike Muspelheim, interestingly enough. Since it contained no known lifeforms, we can admit that damage is irrelevant. Lastly, ourselves, the (...)
botania.page.elvenLore4=&oelves of Alfheim, the damage on our world was somewhat split. The Salamander and Undine clans suffered a massive cut on their population, due to the unstableness of their volcanic and aquatic environments, respectively. Most of the Sylph were completely intact due to their extraordinary flight capabilities, the (...)
botania.page.elvenLore5=&oSpriggan also had fairly small scale consequences. During that time our civilization prospects were fairly weak and our choices of residence were mostly just huts made of Dreamwood, so, luckily, rebuilding was little of a chore. Allewyn, our emissary in Asgard witnessed this happening, everything happened faster (...)

Thor shattering the Bifrost with Mjolnir, her command to evacuate all of the elven civilization residing in Midgard, luckily she was here unscathed, or at least that's what records say, regardless, a few millennia later, she's passed off long ago. Right now our major concern is the status of Midgard. (...)
botania.page.elvenLore7=&oThe collapse of the Bifrost broke any interaction between the various worlds, but the sheer quantity of Mana residues we have left behind will surely have lingered and infused the world with life all over again, be it animal, floral or fungal, natural or magical in essence. We hope it's enough to create intelligent life that can properly harness it though.

# - MISCLANEOUS
# -- UNSTABLE CUBE
botania.entry.unstableBlocks=Unstable Cubes
botania.page.unstableBlocks0=Fiddling with highly powerful &4Mana&0 infused objects has lead to the creation of these strange cubes. They seem to emit some visual radiation in the form of colorful lightning, but it doesn't seem like it has any effects other than visual appeal.
botania.page.unstableBlocks1=They look fancy
botania.page.unstableBlocks2=And they come in all 16 colors
botania.page.unstableBlocks3=There's also a way of creating a different version of these that releases an extremely larger amount of energy, this time in the form of a beam towards the sky that extends into a cloud of sorts. This one also seems to be disableable via a &4Redstone Signal&0, it's called an &1Unstable Beacon&0, as it looks like one somehow.
botania.page.unstableBlocks4=Fireworks?
botania.page.unstableBlocks5=Combined entropy
botania.page.unstableBlocks6=It's also possible, by using the &1Unstable Beacons&0, to turn them into a manageable and portable utility, in the form of the &1Signal Flare&0.<br>This gun of sorts shoots a colored round into the sky that lasts a few seconds, it also stuns any nearby enemies for just as long.
botania.page.unstableBlocks7=Shoot in case of titan

# -- DECORATIVE BLOCKS
botania.entry.decorativeBlocks=Decorative Blocks
botania.page.decorativeBlocks0=Past functionality, quite a few decorative blocks are available to make your builds look better.<br>Starting off. It's possible to turn blocks of &1Livingrock&0 and &1Livingwood&0 into decorative blocks. Each of them features 4 different decorative variations.
botania.page.decorativeBlocks1=Livingrock bricks.
botania.page.decorativeBlocks2=Mossing the bricks

botania.page.decorativeBlocks9=Glimmering livingwood
botania.page.decorativeBlocks10=Carrying on, by combining &1Nether Quartz&0 with all sorts of other substances, it's possible to create a wide array of other decorative &1Quartz&0 blocks.<br>As expected, all these items can be crafted into all their decorative block counterparts just like regular &1Quartz&0 blocks are crafted. 
botania.page.decorativeBlocks11=Smokey Quartz
botania.page.decorativeBlocks12=Mana Quartz

# -- DISPENSER TWEAKS
botania.entry.dispenserTweaks=Dispenser Tweaks
botania.page.dispenserTweaks0=&1Dispensers&0, among their normal abilities, can also plant all sorts of crops, from &1Seeds&0, &1Potatos&0 or &1Carrots&0 to even &1Nether Wart&0. The crop is planted in the block right in front of the dispenser.<br>The &1Dispensers&0 can also use the &1Wand of the Forest&0 for some specific tasks such as triggering a &1Runic Altar&0.

# -- GLIMMERING FLOWERS
botania.entry.shinyFlowers=Glimmering Flowers
botania.page.shinyFlowers0=By combining your typical &1Mystical Flowers&0 with some &1Glowstone Dust&0, you can make them sparkle even brighter, and emit actual physical light, of the same brightness as a &1Glowstone Block&0.<br>With some &1Dirt&0 and &1Pasture Seeds&0 it's possible to turn them into a miniature floating island that will not only emit light, but also look very fancy indeed.
botania.page.shinyFlowers3=Combining any color of &1Floating Flower&0 with any flower that has an effect (any &4Functional or Generating Flower&0, etc) in a crafting table will join the two, allowing for both the look and properties of a &1Floating Flower&0 and the effects of the flower chosen in one block. Lastly, right clicking a floating flower in the world with any type of &1Pasture Seed&0 or a &1Snowball&0 will change its look.
botania.page.shinyFlowers1=Pretty Pretty Shiny Shiny
botania.page.shinyFlowers2=Like Laputa but (a lot) tinier

# -- PRISMARINE
botania.entry.prismarine=Prismarine
botania.page.prismarine0=&1Prismarine&0 is an interesting component and building block. Some scholars even go as far as to say it comes from &4the future&0.<br>To create it, one requires an &1Alchemy Catalyst&0. Simply tossing some &1Nether Quartz&0 into a &1Mana Pool&0 with the catalyst attached to it will get some of this material.
botania.page.prismarine1=There's various building blocks that can be created using the &1Prismarine Shards&0, to which all but the &1Sea Lantern&0 can be turned into their &1Stair&0 and &1Slab&0 variants.

# -- NATURAL SHEDDING
botania.entry.shedding=Natural Shedding
botania.page.shedding0=The living and unliving beings that inhabit our lands don't live in a static state. It's common for pieces of their body to fall out, or for them to drop things, or for them to extrude substances. The following pages list some such items that can come from such entities.

# -- TINY POTATO
botania.entry.tinyPotato=Tiny Potato
botania.page.tinyPotato0=It's a tiny potato, it believes in you, you can do the thing.<br>No really, that's it, by tossing a &1Potato&0 in a &1Mana Pool&0, the potato gains a little lively essence and happy feeling. It's a lively one, giving it a right click will make it even more so!<br>It can also be named in an &1Anvil&0.
botania.page.tinyPotato1=Put it on Kickstarter, it'll work 

# -- HEAD CREATION
botania.entry.headCreating=Head Creation
botania.page.headCreating0=A typical incantation of the Elves, combining a few resources and a &1Name Tag&0 allows for the creation of a replica of sorts of the head of the person described in the tag. How it works isn't really known, but it seems to be possible to replicate it with a &1Runic Altar&0.
botania.page.headCreating1=Get your head in the game

# -- AZULEJO -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azulejo
botania.entry.azulejo=Azulejos
botania.page.azulejo0=&1Azulejos&0 are a type of decorative block, simply put, they are tileable patterns of blue and white. To create them, one would simply mix a piece of &1Lapis Lazuli&0 with a &1Block of Quartz&0.<br>From there, placing it in the crafting grid allows for cycling between the twelve different patterns.
botania.page.azulejo1=The various patterns
botania.page.azulejo2=Crafting a block of &1Azulejo&0

# -- STARFIELD CREATOR
botania.entry.starfield=Starfield Creator
botania.page.starfield0=The &1Starfield Creator&0 does exactly as it says, by releasing elven energies into the air, if it's placed in the world, during night time it will create a starry sky that extends for a fair distance.
botania.page.starfield1=Twinkle twinkle

# -- TRODDEN DIRT
botania.entry.dirtPath=Trodden Dirt
botania.page.dirtPath0=&1Trodden Dirt&0 is a type of soil that works perfectly for the creation of natural looking artificial paths through landscape. Similarly to &1Farmland&0, it's slightly inset into the ground, walking on it also provides a small speed boost.
botania.page.dirtPath1=Follow the yellow dirt road
botania.page.dirtPath2=Also available in slabs

# -- SHIMMERING MUSHROOMS
botania.entry.mushrooms=Shimmering Mushrooms
botania.page.mushrooms0=Sprinkling some &1Floral Powder&0 on &1Mushrooms&0 seems to have the interesting effect of them mutating into the respective color of powder, gaining a new shape and getting the ability to emit dim light. They don't seem to do anything besides look interesting.<br>These can also be seldom found deep underground in isolated patches.
botania.page.mushrooms1=They don't make you bigger

# -- PHANTOM INK
botania.entry.phantomInk=Phantom Ink
botania.page.phantomInk0=Having your beautiful skin and acessories under a set of metal armor is nobody's dream. It's bulky, flat, and worst of all, not fashionable!<br>Luckilly, by tinging this horrendous armor with &1Phantom Ink&0 in a crafting grid, the armor will be completely invisible, while still providing all of its benefits. This will onlt work with armor sets that can use &4Mana&0.
botania.page.phantomInk1=Who you gonna call?

# -- STONE ALCHEMY
botania.entry.stoneAlchemy=Stone Alchemy
botania.page.stoneAlchemy0=Using an &1Alchemy Catalyst&0 proves to be a decently functional method of generating new types of &1Stone&0. Simple deal, tossing a piece of &1Stone&0 into the catalized pool will transform it into another in a cyle.<br>Similarly to &1Prismarine&0, some scholars admit that this technique came from the future. Stairs and slabs can be made from the rough and brick variants of these.

# -- BLAZE LIGHT
botania.entry.blazeBlock=Blaze Light
botania.page.blazeBlock0=Smashing a bunch of &1Blaze Rods&0 together makes a usable decorative light block. A crude one, admittedly, but a source of light non the less.<br>Naturally, like a &1Block of Coal&0, the &1Blaze Light&0 can also be used to fuel furnaces and other fuel consumers alike. Putting it next to a &1Pure Daisy&0 converts it into &1Obsidian&0, strangely enough.
botania.page.blazeBlock1=0x1a4

# -- THAUMCRAFT INTEGRATION
botania.entry.tcIntegration=사움크래프트 지원
botania.page.tcIntegration0=Often enough, the paths of &4Botany&0 and &4Thaumaturgy&0 cross together. Mixing some of the artifacts mentioned in this book as well as any from the school of &5Thaumcraft&0 can allow for combinations of these to form.
botania.page.tcIntegration1=First and foremost, combining any of the &1Mana Metal&0 helms with a set of &1Goggles of Revealing&0 allows for a combination of both.<br>The protection and regenerability of the armor works alongside the Goggles' abilities, but the &4Vis&0 discount is lost. 
botania.page.tcIntegration2=Helmets of Revealing (works with any Botania helm)
botania.page.tcIntegration3=Carrying on, &4Mana&0 can also serve as an interesting type of Ink. Infusing a set of black &1Scribing Tools&0 with &4Mana&0 from a &1Mana Pool&0 allows for them to use said &4Mana&0 as their source of color.<br>Refilling these tools works similarly to a &1Mana Tablet&0, done by tossing it on top of the pool. It's to note that the tools do not come pre-filled.
botania.page.tcIntegration4=Making the &1Botanurgist's Inkwell
botania.page.tcIntegration5=Next off, there's a few varied resources or constructs that can work as paraphernalia for an &1Infusion Altar&0, to lower its' instability, these come in the form of &1Glimmering Flowers, Floating Flowers and any variety of Pylons&0.<br>Lastly, a special &4Brew&0 can be put together using typical thaumaturgic resources in order to apply a &4Warp Ward&0 effect.
botania.page.tcIntegration6a=Perhaps insanity might not be the greatest tool in all of occasions. For those cases, a nice bath generally takes care of it. A brew might be a better format for such a task, though...
botania.page.tcIntegration6b=The official frowny face

# -- BUILDCRAFT INTEGRATION
botania.entry.bcIntegration=빌드크래프트 지원
botania.page.bcIntegration0=Recent advances in piping technology have allowed &1Gates&0 to get a feel of the &4Mana&0 around them. A &1Gate&0 can now sense whether a &4Mana&0 container is empty, full or if it contains any mana.<br>&1Gates&0 can also use the &1Mana Detector&0 trigger to detect if a mana is passing by the pipe block. In addition, they can also sense when a &1Runic Altar&0 is ready to create runes.
